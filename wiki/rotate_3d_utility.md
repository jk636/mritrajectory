# 3D Rotation Utility Example

(To be filled in after utility implementation.)

This page will demonstrate how to use the 3D rotation utility to rotate existing 3D k-space trajectories around specified axes by given angles. This can be useful for creating more complex sampling patterns or for aligning trajectories with specific anatomical features.
