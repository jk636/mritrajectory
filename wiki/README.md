# Trajectory Generation Wiki

Welcome to the documentation for the MRI k-space trajectory generation library.
This wiki provides examples and explanations for various features, including:

- How to generate different types of k-space trajectories.
- How to use utility functions for trajectory manipulation.
- How to assess trajectory properties based on design principles.
