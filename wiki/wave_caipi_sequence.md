# Wave-CAIPI Sequence Example

(To be filled in after Wave-CAIPI sequence implementation.)

This page will demonstrate the generation of Wave-CAIPI (Controlled Aliasing in Parallel Imaging) trajectories. Wave-CAIPI sequences utilize sinusoidal gradients during readout to achieve controlled aliasing patterns, enabling highly accelerated 3D imaging.
